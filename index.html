                <p>After you turn on your Handibot, the first thing you will typically want to do is to accurately set the 0 location for each axis. Just click this green button.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <hr width = "90%" noshade>

                <p>If you have changed your cutter, you will need to re-measure its length. Measuring the cutter is done for you by the tool "touching-off" on the Z-Zeroing plate. Rotate the plate into position (its an aluminum bar on the right inside of the base), then click this button.</p>

            <h2>Detailed Info on this FireUp! App</h2>
            <p>This is a "helper" App for you Handibot. After you become knowledgeable and comfortable in the use of your tool, you may find you don't use it anymore. Feel free to delete it (you can alwasy get it back from the Handibot website)</p>
            <h3>Setting the XYZ Zero Locations</h3>
            	<p>The Zeroing of an axis is automatically done for you by moving into the end-stops of the axis and then backing off an exact known distance to the location where Zero for the particular axis is set.</p>
            	<p>The back-off distance is determined at the factory and saved as a persistant variable. As you get more experienced, you may want to change the back-off distance in order to move your zero locations to better suit your work, for a particular project, or just to make a slight adjustment of your zero location. You can modify the back-off distance for each axis in the <code>Preferences</code> tab.</p>
            	<p>Using the XYZ Zero function in this app is the same thing as clicking on <strong>Macro#3</strong> in the system macros, where the motion instructions are stored. It also the same as using the <strong>[C3] Command</strong> in the Sb4 App or in the OpenSBP fabrication language. You can use each, interchangeably.</p> 

        		<div class="well" id="config-system-config">
              		Your tool moves around in a Cartesean coordinate system. The X axis (right/left) and the Y axis (back/front) are in the plane of the material. X = 0 and Y = 0 are at the bottom left corner as you face the front of the tool. Moving the tool head to the right is moving in increasing value in the X axis, moving it towards the back is moving it in increasing value the Y axis. Downward movement of the Z axis, the up/down motion of the router, is negative. Zero in the Z is typically set to the height of the surface of the material, though it need not be. To explore the coordinate system, Play with the keypad on in the red, DRO panel on the right:
					<h3><a class="btn btn-success" id="call-DRO-rollout"> click here if the KEYPAD is not visble </a></h3>
              		Or even more interesting, try out the "Touch-and-Go App" by clicking here:
              		<h3><a class="btn btn-success" id="call-touch-and-go"> start: Touch-and-Go </a></h3>
            	</div>

            <h3>Measuring Bit Length</h3>
            	<p>Measuring Bit Length is sometimes called Z-Zeoring, because we are really determing the zero location for the tip of the cutter in the Z axis. More importantly for a Handibot, we are determining the back-off distance from the top Z-axis stop to having the tip of the cutter exactly at the material (at Zero). Your tool uses electrical contact with a Z-zero plate to tell exactly the distance the tip of the cutter from the stop. It then adds the known distance from the Z-zero plate to the material surface in order to calculate an overall back-off distance that we call, "current_cutter_Zoffset". So it is not really a measurement of the actual length of the bit, but the determination of an offset distance that is based on the exposed length of the cutter.</p>
            	<p>You will also see the "current_cutter_Zoffset" in the <code>Preferences</code> tab.</p>

          <h2>Preference Settings</h2>
	          <p>Your Handibot contains a number of variables with preset values that is uses in some of the operations it does to assist you. These variables all have default values that come installed with your tool, but you are able to modify them to suit your specific needs. After you change them, the values will persist even when the tool is turned off. They are called "persistent variables".</p>
	          <p>There are several ways these variables can be modified, but the simplest approach is to just change them here.</p>
